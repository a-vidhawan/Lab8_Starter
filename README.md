### Graceful Degradtaion x Service Workers
Graceful Degradation is the concept that you implement or start implementing your software from the highest level, and with it's richest features. We hen hope that the design we have for the higher levels graceful degrades on lower capacity systems. Service Workers are like a Rich Feature that gracefully degrades at the network level. When supported, Service Workers provide safety to your application. When not supported -- everything continues workin but your browser now has to rely on network requests.
